# Frequency Scripts

* `cpu_gauge.sh` and `info_cpu_gauge.sh` display current core frequencies in KHz.
* `pstate_perf.sh` and `pstate_save.sh` can be used to change the power governor for `pstate` driver.
* `fixed_freq.sh` and `min_max_freq.sh` can be used to fix core frequencies to a fixed or between a min-max value range, respectively.
